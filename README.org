* GHCJS Examples
** hello
Hello World example, uses the bare minimum of functions from
=ghcjs-dom= to get text into the browser window.
** embed
Only slightly more elaborate than =hello=, sets a large chunk of
static HTML, and then selects several elements by id.  The use of
~documentGetElementById~ is important.  The use of ~embedFile~ is not
so important.  Both will disappear as I move to better libraries for
constructing HTML.
** hamlet
Use =hamlet= and =blaze-html= to create the inner HTML content.
** timer
A countdown timer using an MVar event queue to tie the knot.  Callbacks on DOM elements add events to the queue.  A single Haskell thread pops events from the queue and updates the (global) state.  A ~render~ function is called in a loop by ~requestAnimationFrame~ and updates the DOM based on the global state.
